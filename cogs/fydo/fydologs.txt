[2017-07-05 04:03] <TehFyd0#2685> The Starbucks Pokemon Go blend sounds good to me.
[2017-07-05 04:12] <TehFyd0#2685> Its vanilla bean with raspberry and blackberry and whipped cream
[2017-07-05 04:12] <TehFyd0#2685> I think id like it
[2017-07-05 04:33] <TehFyd0#2685> Pfft i dont make the names
[2017-07-05 04:51] <TehFyd0#2685> Vanilla bean is to take you back to the good old days of pokemon to make you feel good. Raspberry is to remind that the pokemon universe is not safe, which why professor wont let you leave without a pokemon. Blackberry is to bring all the dark mysteries and evils of the universe to mind and really give you that feel of being a pokemon trainer. Last but probably least (in quantity that they include) the whipped cream to let you relive those great memories of when you spent time with your favourite pokemon.\nIts like a complement sandwhich really.
[2017-07-05 05:50] <TehFyd0#2685> Yea but you probably shouldnt quote me on that if they ask you why you wanted it.
[2017-07-05 05:50] <TehFyd0#2685> ;p
[2017-07-05 08:11] <TehFyd0#2685> Kool

[2017-07-05 08:23] <TehFyd0#2685> Crud i thought it was gonna be free
[2017-07-05 08:25] <TehFyd0#2685> IAP. They could make plenty of money with IAP. Theres really no need for both.
[2017-07-05 08:27] <TehFyd0#2685> Well lets take a look on the brighter side of things...\nThis here sounds really cool... tho unfortunate for late-comers.

[2017-08-01 02:22] <TehFyd0#2685> Uhh well you could go with that and just allow the people to learn the characters as you create more. Otherwise, (tho id hate to incourage you take ideas) maybe you could do something like borderlands does when they introduce a new/returning character.
[2017-08-01 02:22] <TehFyd0#2685> Tis a game
[2017-08-01 02:23] <TehFyd0#2685> I find it humourus
[2017-08-01 02:24] <TehFyd0#2685> Pretty much what borderlands does is introduce by exagerativly joking about the characters personality
[2017-08-01 02:27] <TehFyd0#2685> Wowzers. Realzies people eh.
[2017-08-01 02:29] <TehFyd0#2685> You can put their name where it fits and doesnt seem as tho its too much in the way

[2017-09-15 07:49] <TehFyd0#2685> Nah thats not the problem. Im always home and they know it. They know im always in my room and when im not in my room usually know. I can scare them easy but I gotta keep it simple. Things that are sudden like jump scares.
[2017-09-15 07:52] <TehFyd0#2685> Me actually tryin to scare them in a different way than that just dont work.\n\nIf you were going to sleep and suddenly you see a person staring into your window that lifted from the ground how would you react?
[2017-09-15 07:52] <TehFyd0#2685> On a side note. Why are you always invisible?

[2017-09-25 03:26] <TehFyd0#2685> I just heated some soup in a microwave and I think its now legally considered a hazard towards humanity due to how extremely hot it is.\nAs side note however... it smells like a mixture of vienna suasages and soft cat food.

[2017-09-25 18:18] <TehFyd0#2685> "Even if you jump, you\'re just a flea"\n\nI assume that means theyre small and insignificant and maybe that they arent cared about?\nWell I find that fleas are not insignificant and should be cared about. Cuase if you dont acknowledge them, they will become very populous and noticable and no longer will it be "just a spot" in front of you. ;P
[2017-09-25 18:20] <TehFyd0#2685> Now I feel as tho I should feel bad for making fun of it... but I dont.

[2017-10-05 00:53] <TehFyd0#2685> I dont keep them indoors because thatd be a complete hell for them considering how small our place is and our neighborhood is not very populated... also its dead end.
[2017-10-05 00:53] <TehFyd0#2685> Theres plenty of mice rats and snakes
[2017-10-05 00:53] <TehFyd0#2685> And birds
[2017-10-05 00:55] <TehFyd0#2685> They live inside but (will) go out as they please.\nMomma cat is too used to me feeding her and the kittems are still too young
[2017-10-05 00:55] <TehFyd0#2685> They hunt eachother :P

[2018-02-18 05:57] <TehFyd0#2685> The way ive seen it enforced thus far is\nPretty much, if youre young, keep it within two years apart\nIf youre older, all goes but keep it legal.

[2018-02-25 08:40] <TehFyd0#2685> So really it doesnt even matter how many times o refresh
[2018-02-25 08:41] <TehFyd0#2685> I suppose I could\nBut I wouldnt know where im going without using the link :I
[2018-02-25 08:43] <TehFyd0#2685> Meh

[2018-03-20 20:04] <TehFyd0#2685> Oh ok. I read on something Knights had shared that it starts the player with bots and gradually adds human players.
[2018-03-20 20:05] <TehFyd0#2685> Well I assumed bots because because according to the reviews all the players are getting wins on their first play :P
[2018-03-20 20:06] <TehFyd0#2685> But meh... I could be wrong.
[2018-03-20 20:07] <TehFyd0#2685> Heheh you felt good. Thats exactly what the article wanted the player to feel about their first time ;3
[2018-03-20 20:11] <TehFyd0#2685> I never do period. That sorta thing just dont work on me.\nI play games and I like a challenge and when I "play like a pro" its usually cause bots are placed prior. I hate it and it always causes me to quit a game before it gets good
[2018-03-20 20:13] <TehFyd0#2685> Ive played three games recently that had the same system and I liked the gameplay but after the 3rd online match I was sick of it. Kept playing so I could try and progress out of the bots but I just couldnt do it.
[2018-03-20 20:13] <TehFyd0#2685> The matches were too dull
[2018-03-20 20:14] <TehFyd0#2685> I poured my heart and soul into all that text and you respond with a simple "very understandable!?

[2018-03-29 19:47] <TehFyd0#2685> Some kids' feildtrip was cancelled yesterday becuase of rain.\n\nOutta the blue they just immediately blame satan.\nThey couldn't go on the trip because of satan he made it happen on purpose because he is a bad person.\n\nBy that logic, satan can control the rain/weather because be is the one that made it which would in turn mean that satan really isnt a bad person because the earth and its residents need the water to survive. So with his water he either created all life and what we think we know about jesus is all wrong or he helps to sustain life on earth thru the ages. Either way, he really doesnt seem to be such a bad dude, and jesus is a total prick for forcing him out of heaven and taking command of his sanctuary.\n\xf0\x9f\x98\x95 \xf0\x9f\x99\x83 \xf0\x9f\x98\x95 \xf0\x9f\x99\x83 \xf0\x9f\x98\x95 \xf0\x9f\x99\x83 \xf0\x9f\x98\x95

[2018-04-30 03:26] <TehFyd0#2685> They out trash talked you O.O
[2018-04-30 03:26] <TehFyd0#2685> Oh noes
[2018-04-30 03:27] <TehFyd0#2685> I once played a match while at school and I was winning but then
[2018-04-30 03:27] <TehFyd0#2685> The other player asked me if I was white
[2018-04-30 03:27] <TehFyd0#2685> And that threw me off
[2018-04-30 03:28] <TehFyd0#2685> I started talking with them and lost my focus
[2018-04-30 03:28] <TehFyd0#2685> And lost
[2018-04-30 03:28] <TehFyd0#2685> Apparently white people are good
[2018-04-30 03:28] <TehFyd0#2685> And they dint like playing with the blaxks
[2018-04-30 03:28] <TehFyd0#2685> xD
[2018-04-30 03:29] <TehFyd0#2685> Thats the bestest part
[2018-04-30 03:29] <TehFyd0#2685> Its so hard to get across
[2018-04-30 03:30] <TehFyd0#2685> Neither of those are hard
[2018-04-30 03:31] <TehFyd0#2685> Besides im usually called a cheater for doing those
[2018-04-30 03:32] <TehFyd0#2685> Oh yea
[2018-04-30 03:32] <TehFyd0#2685> Thats what O meant
[2018-04-30 03:32] <TehFyd0#2685> Yea that other stuff would be hard to explain xD
[2018-04-30 03:33] <TehFyd0#2685> Ive tried to explain to several people and they just say\nFuck it whatever
[2018-04-30 03:35] <TehFyd0#2685> They become butt buddies
[2018-04-30 03:35] <TehFyd0#2685> Thus latching to eachothers sides
[2018-04-30 03:35] <TehFyd0#2685> Lol jk
[2018-04-30 03:37] <TehFyd0#2685> Ye
[2018-04-30 03:37] <TehFyd0#2685> But its more the fact that they dont understand how it works or why
[2018-04-30 03:38] <TehFyd0#2685> ...
[2018-04-30 03:40] <TehFyd0#2685> I say
[2018-04-30 03:41] <TehFyd0#2685> Ignore the way a piece...\nBecause by doing that you insert the pawn into a lane that no longer has an opposing pawn thus making it easier to get all the way across
[2018-04-30 03:41] <TehFyd0#2685> And youll have a better chance of promotion
[2018-04-30 03:42] <TehFyd0#2685> Good way to think of it
[2018-04-30 03:44] <TehFyd0#2685> Coukd be but ive very rarely played chess with anyone without that rule so ive come to accept it as legit
[2018-04-30 03:44] <TehFyd0#2685> Also in rules ive read it mentions it so... Yea
[2018-04-30 03:45] <TehFyd0#2685> Yea
[2018-04-30 03:45] <TehFyd0#2685> Fishy for sure
[2018-04-30 03:46] <TehFyd0#2685> Be careful about using your pawn too much then
